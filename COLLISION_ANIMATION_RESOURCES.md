# Collision Animation Resources & Optimization Guide

This document contains comprehensive research and resources for implementing enhanced shield collision detection with performant visual effects in our React/Next.js space game.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Game Loop**: Centralized `requestAnimationFrame` in `GameCanvas.tsx` 
- **Collision Detection**: AABB collision with QuadTree spatial partitioning
- **State Management**: Zustand store with optimized selectors
- **Rendering**: React Konva with 3-layer architecture
- **Performance**: Object pooling for bullets (300), enemies (150), particles (500)

### Current Shield System
- **Position**: Bottom of screen, configurable height (50px default)
- **Health System**: 0-100 health, regeneration after 3s delay
- **Collision Response**: Color-coded damage feedback (cyan for shield, red for health)
- **Visual Effects**: Basic impact particles (8 per collision) and explosions (12-20 particles)

## Performance Optimization Research

### AABB Collision Detection (2024 Best Practices)
**Performance Characteristics:**
- AABB remains fastest algorithm for overlap detection
- Benchmarks show significant speed advantage over SAT (Separating Axis Theorem)
- Ideal for high-entity-count scenarios (our current architecture)

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Spatial Partitioning**: QuadTree reduces complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n)
- **Cache-Friendly Structures**: Modern physics engines use binary AABB-Trees
- **Hybrid Approaches**: AABB for broad-phase, detailed checks for narrow-phase
- **Min/Max Coordinates**: Fastest convention for intersection tests

**Implementation Best Practices:**
```javascript
// Optimized AABB check (current implementation is already optimal)
function checkAABBCollision(a, b) {
  return !(a.x + a.width < b.x || 
           b.x + b.width < a.x || 
           a.y + a.height < b.y || 
           b.y + b.height < a.y);
}
```

### Particle System Performance

**Canvas 2D Performance:**
- **Limit**: ~5,000 particles at 60fps for Canvas 2D
- **Bottleneck**: Individual drawImage() calls, not calculations
- **Optimization**: Use drawImage from another canvas instead of fillRect

**WebGL Advantages:**
- **Performance**: 7.2 million particles/second possible
- **GPU-Based**: Entire simulation can run on GPU
- **Efficiency**: Pass only delta time per frame to GPU

**Our Context (React Konva):**
- Stick with Canvas 2D for compatibility with existing architecture
- Focus on optimizing particle count and lifecycle management
- Use object pooling (already implemented)

## Visual Effects Resources

### React Konva Animation Techniques

**Konva Animation Methods:**
1. **Tween**: For smooth interpolated animations
2. **Animation**: For custom frame-by-frame control
3. **React State**: For declarative animations

**Collision Detection Examples:**
- [Konva Collision Detection Demo](https://konvajs.org/docs/sandbox/Collision_Detection.html)
- Simple bounding box collision with visual feedback
- Highlighting intersected objects pattern

**Advanced Techniques:**
```javascript
// Declarative animation with React Konva
new Konva.Tween({
  node: shape,
  duration: 0.5,
  scaleX: 1.5,
  scaleY: 1.5,
  onFinish: () => {
    // Reset or cleanup
  }
});
```

activeEntities.forEach(entity => quadtree.insert(entity));
const candidates = quadtree.retrieve(targetEntity);
```

## Animation Effect Specifications

### Shield Collision Animation Goals

**Immediate Impact Effects:**
- Ripple wave animation across shield surface
- Color pulse based on damage severity
- Particle burst at collision point
- Screen shake for significant hits

**Sustained Effects:**
- Shield energy fluctuation during low health
- Pulsing warning states
- Energy drain visualization
- Recovery animation sequences

**Performance Targets:**
- Maintain 60fps with multiple simultaneous collisions
- Particle count limit: 500 (current pool size)
- Animation duration: 0.3-1.0 seconds max
- Memory leak prevention through object pooling

### Particle Effect Types

**Collision Particles (Enhanced):**
```javascript
// Current: 8 particles per impact
// Enhanced: 12-16 particles with better physics
const createEnhancedImpact = (x, y, severity) => {
  const particleCount = Math.min(16, 8 + severity * 2);
  const colors = severity > 0.7 ? 
    ['#ff0000', '#ff4400', '#ffaa00'] : // High damage
    ['#00ffff', '#44aaff', '#88ccff']; // Shield damage
  
  // Radial burst with physics
  for (let i = 0; i < particleCount; i++) {
    const angle = (Math.PI * 2 * i) / particleCount;
    const velocity = 100 + severity * 150;
    // Create particle with angle-based velocity
  }
};
```

**Shield Ripple Effect:**
```javascript
// New implementation needed
const createShieldRipple = (impactX, impactY) => {
  // Expanding circle animation
  // Opacity fade over time
  // Multiple concentric circles
  // Duration: 0.5-0.8 seconds
};
```

### Screen Effects (Post-Processing)

**Flash Effects:**
- White flash for critical hits
- Red tint for health damage
- Blue flash for shield impacts
- Duration: 0.1-0.2 seconds

**Camera Shake:**
```javascript
// Lightweight shake implementation
const createCameraShake = (intensity, duration) => {
  const amplitude = intensity * 5; // Max 5px displacement
  const frequency = 30; // Oscillations per second
  // Apply to game container transform
};
```
